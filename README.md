# Work samples
Samples of R/ Python code and theory question attempts for school application purposes. For a more complete project, please check out the [diffBUM-HMM pipeline](https://github.com/marangiop/diff_BUM_HMM).

## Data Mining
A collection of coding assignments completed for the Data Mining I (636-0018-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Folders contain all necessary input data to run the Python scripts, and instructions on how to run on cmd are included in the task description pdf files.

## Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics
Coding assignments completed for the Computational Biology (636-0017-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Each of the folders contain task descriptions, their implementation in R, and a test suite for evaluation purposes.

To run the test suite, please set the working directory in the run_test.R script to the local directory, and source both the implementation.R and run_test.R scripts in R studio. More instructions can be found at the end of [Task_description.pdf](./Genomics_and_Evolutionary_Genetics/Needleman_Wunsch_and_Smith_Waterman/Task_description.pdf).

## Probability and Statistics
Coding and problem solving assignments completed for the Stochastics (Probability and Statistics) course (406-0603-AAS) at ETH Zurich. R scripts contain the task descriptions as well as solutions in code. The pdf files contained scanned workings of problems contained in the [Statistics for Research handbook](./Probability_and_Statistics/Statistics_for_Research_(source_of_questions).pdf).

### For current students of ETH Zurich:
Please do not copy, distribute and modify the contents of this repository for any personal purposes. Plagarism is never tolerated at ETH Zurich, and all course administrators strictly screen for attempts that plagarizes work submitted by students in previous years. There is much to learn from the the process of hammering this out on your own and with your peers.
