## Data Mining
A collection of coding assignments completed for the Data Mining I (636-0018-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Folders contain all necessary input data to run the Python scripts, and instructions on how to run on cmd are included in the task description pdf files.

## Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics
Coding assignments completed for the Computational Biology (636-0017-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Each of the folders contain task descriptions, their implementation in R, and a test suite for evaluation purposes.

To run the test suite, please set the working directory in the run_test.R script to the local directory, and source both the implementation.R and run_test.R scripts in R studio. More instructions can be found at the end of [Task_description.pdf](./Genomics_and_Evolutionary_Genetics/Needleman_Wunsch_and_Smith_Waterman/Task_description.pdf).

## Probability and Statistics
Coding and problem solving assignments completed for the Stochastics (Probability and Statistics) course (406-0603-AAS) at ETH Zurich. R scripts contain the task descriptions as well as solutions in code. The pdf files contained scanned workings of problems contained in the [Statistics for Research handbook](./Probability_and_Statistics/Statistics_for_Research_(source_of_questions).pdf).

## Data Visualization
Visualization of graphical, geospatial and text data using R packages, coding and problem solving assignments completed for the Data Visualization course (QMSS-G5063) at Columbia University. Please see [README.md](./Data_Visualization/Airbnbs_in_NYC/readme.md) for the task description.

## Package development
[WHO_GHO_API_client](https://github.com/tobykylaw/WHO_GHO_API_client) is a simple API wrapper package for the purpose of accessing, searching and downloading data from the WHO Global Health Observatory database, without having to interact directly with the API itself.

## Text Mining and Analysis with Regex
Analysed 10,000 narratives of injuries to extract, summarize and visualize those related to fractures, using regex expressions and the Python `re` module. Task description and solutions both in [here](./Text_Mining_and_Analysis_with_Regex/Working_with_Regular_Expressions.ipynb). 

## Function testing with `pytest`
Wrote test functions for a cipher function to see if it processes text with different cases, spaces and out-of-range symbols, throws the error errors, constructed a test class and parametrized test cases to submit iteratively to it. Task description and solutions both in [here](./Function_testing_with_pytest/Function_testing_with_pytest.ipynb).

## Object-oriented programming
Defined new object classes in Python with custom attributes and methods, using them to instatiate new objects. Task description and solutions both in [here](./Object_oriented_programming/Object_oriented_programming_in_Python.ipynb)

### To current students of ETH Zurich and Columbia University:
Please do not copy, distribute and modify the contents of this repository for any personal purposes. Plagarism is never tolerated, and all course administrators strictly screen for attempts that plagarizes work submitted by students in previous years. There is much to learn from the the process of hammering this out on your own and with your peers.
