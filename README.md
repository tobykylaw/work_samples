# Work samples
Samples of R/ Python code and theory question attempts for school application purposes.

# Data Mining
A collection of coding assignments completed for the Data Mining I (636-0018-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Folders contain all necessary input data to run the Python scripts, and instructions on how to run on cmd are included in the task description pdf files.

# Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics
Coding assignments completed for the Computational Biology (636-0017-00L) course at ETH Zurich. Folders contain task descriptions, their implementation in R, and a test suite for evaluation purposes. 
To run the test suite, please set the working directory in the run_test.R script to the local directory, and source both the implementation.R and run_test.R scripts in R studio. More instructions can be found at the end of [Task_description.pdf](Genomics_and_Evolutionary_Genetics/Needleman_Wunsch_and_Smith_Waterman/Task_Description.pdf).
