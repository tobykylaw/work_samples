# Working with Strings and Regex Expressions

## Task Summary

Using regex expressions and the python `re` module:
- Extracted narratives about fractures from a random sample of 10,000 narratives of injuries.
- Identified and summarized the physical location of the fractures, grouped into major body parts and tallied in a bar plot.
- Extracted age and gender from the narratives, taking into consideration a wide range of variety in notation.
- Visualized the relationship between number of instances of fractures vs. age, to see which age ranges are more prone to fractures.
- Results disaggregated by gender (male and female), to inspect differences in the above relationship between genders.
